# Learn DevOps

Hey there! Thanks for peeking in. Welcome to "Learn DevOps", a repository where I document my journey onto the world of DevOps.

It's been a wild ride, and I'm excited to share my experiences, challenges, and wins with you.

## Scripting

Scripting is a foundational skill in DevOps that empowers you to work smarter, not harder. It enables you to automate, streamline, and scale your operations, making your life as a DevOps engineer much easier.

With Bash you can automate repetitive tasks, manage system configurations, and orchestrate complex workflows.

And Python is versatile and powerful to handle data processing, system administration, and even web scraping. The extensive libraries and frameworks available in Python have can help further enhanced your productivity and capabilities.

## Projects

I have been following the [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) from [roadmaps.sh](https://roadmaps.sh) to master the ocean of Tools, Techniques and more.

To gain more inclined hands-on into DevOps, once can take look at the Projects and I took the chance to get my hands dirty with them. You can find my ideas implemented [here](https://github.com/abhinavbharadwajr/learn.devops/tree/master/roadmap-projects).
